## 🚀 Who am I
<p>
Well, like any other programmer <strong>I LOVE</strong> code, but one of my unique traits is that I love innovating, I don't follow a line just because everyone "thinks" it's the best choice, I try to create my own flow. This doesn't mean that I don't know how to work as a team member and respect certain ideas and cultures, it means that I will try my best to optimize every single task, instead of accepting the bare minimum, I'm a Architect (INTJ-A) type personality, which is about less than 2% of the population, who loves spreading knowledge and guidance for those who need it and are open to it.
</p>

<p>With 5 years of experience in web development, fluent in javascript, dedicated and concerned with consistent data structure, not afraid of refactoring and abstracting code using ideas like clean code design.</p>

<p>With 2 years of experience using Vue.js and almost 2 years using React, I can say that I have great mastery using Single Page Applications. Built the entire platform I currently work at, applying atomic design and tests using Jest.js. </p>

<p>Built a web browser game working both with Front-end and Back-end, using Node.js, Vue.js and MongoDB.</p>

<p>I have more than 50 websites under my belt so I believe to be a PRO when it comes to CSS/SASS, HTML5 and UI/UX design.</p>
