👨‍💻   My Personal Projects

📝  Blog

My Blog is where I share knowledge in text. I’m always trying to be as succinct as possible while writing (Twitter-culture fault?). I call the format that I write content “Drops”, which in the end is just an assertive communication exploration that I do while writing webdev content.

📰  Newsletter

My Newsletter is a curated content compilation about Web Development, Job Roles, General Technology News, Self Created Content, Upcoming Events, and many other useful content.

✈️  Telegram Channel

My channel on Telegram I aggregate realtime announcements, content and so on.
